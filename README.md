# factory-plugins
VC3-specific plugins for VC3

This project *must* be able to create an RPM which can be co-installed with the autopyfactory RPM/package. So do not create __init__.py files anywhere (as these will collide). 

This project *should* be able to be copied into a checked out autopyfactory source tree, resulting in installation via regular methods.
